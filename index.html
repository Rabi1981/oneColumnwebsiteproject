                <p>The National Science Foundation awarded a grant to Changing Expectations for a Computer Science for All (CSforALL Research-Practice Partnership).  The RPP consists of education practitioners, policymakers, and researchers working together to solve problems of practice in computer science education. The project is designed to study and increase African-American and Hispanic students with disabilities interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, sense of belonging, and intentions to persist in computer science education and careers. The project is conducting research through the African-American and Hispanic Students with Disabilities in Computer Science Research Alliance, a working group consisting of computer science educators, STEM, CTE, Tech, and Special Educators in school districts, researchers and evaluators.

                    In year two, teachers at five middle and high school sites provided Saturday remote learning sessions to support the targeted students in learning how to create artificial intelligence (AI) voice-enabled chatbots using a project-based approach to solve culturally-relevant problems in student homes, schools, and communities. The project has also provided teacher professional development in IBM Watson’s AI assistant (chatbot), artificial intelligence, special education strategies, universal design, and project-based learning. As a result of this project, African American and Hispanic students with disabilities in secondary schools are learning to be creators of artificial intelligence innovations for social justice, rather than just consumers of technology.
                    
                    In year three, we are working to identify solutions to broadening the participation of African American and Hispanic students with disabilities in computer science education. We are also addressing the importance of elevating issues of racial equity and the intersectionality of race and disability for African American and Hispanic Students with disabilities. Computing and special education teachers again teamed up to implement after school and/or Saturday sessions to support the targeted students in learning how to create artificial intelligence (AI) voice chatbot projects for social justice. The project’s teachers and students have earned IBM digital badges (micro credentials) that demonstrate understanding of creating chatbots by leveraging IBM Watson. Then, teams of students are designing AI voice-enabled chatbot projects to solve student-selected social justice problems for their friends, families, and community members. The Design Justice principles provided guidance to create AI voice chatbot projects led by marginalized communities to dismantle structural inequality and to advance collective liberation and survival for African American and Hispanic people.
                    
                    The Changing Expectations CSforALL RPP has been successful in cultivating African American and Hispanic students with disabilities’ engagement, identity, and sense of belonging in computing.  We also supported these students to develop competencies in inclusive and diverse artificial intelligence education.  African-American and Hispanic students with disabilities attribute the curricula on designing AI voice chatbots for social justice and the learning environment to helping them grow as artificial intelligence learners and developers. However, for these interventions to be sustainable in diversifying the AI field, supports must not only be made available from external sources, particularly AI tech corporations, but also from K12 education sources.  </p>
